ARGUS
AI-Driven Flood Detection & Priority-Based Disaster Response (POC)

ARGUS is an AI-powered backend system for flood detection and disaster response planning.
It uses satellite SAR imagery + deep learning to identify flooded regions and lays the foundation for priority-based resource allocation during disasters.

⚠️ Note: This repository contains a Proof of Concept (POC) model built under hackathon constraints.
The focus is on system feasibility, architecture, and extensibility, not final production accuracy.

🚨 Problem Statement

Floods cause massive damage to lives and infrastructure, yet most existing systems:

Only provide static flood maps

Do not help decision-makers prioritize regions

Fail under cloud cover or extreme weather

ARGUS aims to go beyond detection by enabling:

Reliable flood mapping from SAR data

Backend intelligence for data-driven response prioritization

🧠 What ARGUS Does (POC Scope)

Detects flooded regions using satellite imagery

Generates pixel-level flood masks

Produces structured outputs for downstream decision layers

Demonstrates feasibility of AI-assisted disaster response systems

📊 Data Used
Dataset

ECTI 2021 Flood Detection Dataset

Satellite source: Sentinel-1 SAR

Tile size: 256 × 256

Why SAR?

Works day & night

Penetrates clouds and rain

Reliable during extreme weather events

Input Channels

VV polarization

VH polarization

Derived VV/VH ratio (pseudo-RGB)

⚙️ Preprocessing Pipeline

Intensity normalization to [0, 1]

Conversion of SAR bands into 3-channel input

Resizing to fixed resolution

Optional data augmentation (flip, resize)

🧩 Model Details (POC)
Architecture

Model: U-Net (Semantic Segmentation)

Encoder: ResNet-34

Pretraining: ImageNet (transfer learning)

Framework: PyTorch

Why U-Net?

Designed for pixel-level tasks

Efficient on limited data

Proven in medical & satellite imaging

🏋️ Training Strategy (POC)

Transfer learning enabled

Limited epochs due to compute & time constraints

Dataset undersampling for faster iteration

Loss function: Cross-Entropy Loss

Mixed precision training (AMP)

The model is intentionally lightweight and serves as a functional demonstration, not a final trained system.

📤 Output

Binary flood segmentation mask:

Flooded vs Non-Flooded pixels

Outputs are designed to feed into:

Severity estimation

Priority scoring modules (future work)

🖼️ Visual Results

Sample outputs include:

SAR input images

Predicted flood masks

Water body vs flood differentiation

📁 Visuals & demo outputs are provided via Drive (linked in PPT / submission).

🚧 Limitations (POC)

Trained on limited data

No multi-temporal modeling yet

No population or infrastructure data integration

Accuracy not optimized for production

These are engineering constraints, not conceptual limitations.

🔮 Future Roadmap
Phase 1 – Model Improvements

Full dataset training

Better class imbalance handling

Ensemble models (SAR + Optical)

Phase 2 – Decision Intelligence

Population density integration

Infrastructure & critical asset mapping

Flood severity indexing

Phase 3 – Priority Scoring Engine
Priority Score =
